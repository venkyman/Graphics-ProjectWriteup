{"name":"Computer Graphics","tagline":"Assignment 5 Write-up","body":"## Author\r\nVenkatesh Manickavasagam (vmanicka)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nI am going to work on designing and implementing a framework for rendering **fractal images based on Iterated Function Systems** (Option G). More specifically my goal is to modify the rasterizer from assignment 1 to build a generic tool that accepts parameters (affine transformations and transformation probabilities) and renders fractal images. The steps below contain more details about what features I plan on implementing.\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n1. I will first create a **simple tool** (by modifying the assignment 1 rasterizer) that renders fractal images using the **chaos game** approach by accepting transformation parameters and probabilities. The tool will select an initial seed point and repeatedly apply the transformations based on the provided probability distribution.\r\n2. I will then formulate the transformation functions and probabilities for the **Sierpinski triangle** and the **Barnsley Fern** on paper. I will pass these as parameters to the tool so that it can render the corresponding fractal images.\r\n3. Next, I will implement **supersampling** to prevent spatial aliasing. More specifically, I will first render the fractal image on a larger sample buffer whose dimensions are the dimensions of the screen pixel map multiplied by a power of two. Then, the value of a pixel in the screen pixel map is computed as the average of the samples in the buffer it encompasses.\r\n4. Next, I will formulate a way to **color** the fractal image. Currently, I am thinking about assigning a color to each of the transformation functions and coloring a sample based on the transformation used for the iteration that plotted the sample.\r\n5. Next, I will implement a **distance function** using a flood-fill-like approach to color the background as described in the handout.\r\n6. Next, I will add the **Fractal Flame Algorithm** as a feature in addition to the Chaos games approach. The user can choose one of the two approaches to render the fractal image.\r\n7. Finally, I will try to formulate my own IFS parameters to render a new fractal image.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
